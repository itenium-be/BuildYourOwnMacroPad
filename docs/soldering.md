# Soldering

You'll be divided up into groups, each with their own soldering iron and some basic tools.

We'll need to solder pin headers to our microcontroller, and wires to each of our keyboard switches.

## The microcontroller

In this project we'll be using (a tiny!) microcontroller based on the [RP2040 chip](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/rp2040.html) by Raspberry Pi. Their default board is a bit big for this project though, so we use a tiny board with the same chip on it. The [XIAO RP2040](https://www.seeedstudio.com/XIAO-RP2040-v1-0-p-5026.html).

To make it a bit easier on ourselves (it'll be hard enough already ðŸ˜ƒ) we'll start by soldering headers onto our board.

These are tiny pins we can plug things into later.

Start by making sure you've got 2 rows of 7 pins. Then we'll fit these onto our board, and then stick this upside down onto a breadboard.

Once the board and headers are firmly in their place we'll solder all 14 pins. I'll come by to get everyone started, but make sure to have a look at [this short guide](https://www.makerspaces.com/how-to-solder/).

## The keyboard switches

Each macropad has 6 keyboard switches found in mechanical keyboards (you too can annoy your coworkers starting right now!). Each one of these switches needs 2 wires soldered to them.

First we'll prepare the wires, grab 6 of the long jumper wires and cut them in 3 pieces.

Next we'll strip the wires, you should have 12 in total.

Now we'll solder the wires to our switches, this can be a bit tricky. I like to fold a small loop on the end of the stripped wire and then hook it over the pin of the switch and hold it in place with helping hands or tweezers.
