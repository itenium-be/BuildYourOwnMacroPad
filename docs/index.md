# Build your own Macro pad

We'll build our own macropad in this session. We'll mostly focus on learning to solder and putting everything together.

If we have some time left over, you're more than welcome to get started on the software (well, since this is an electronics project, we'll call it firmware from now on) side as well!

If programming isn't your thing, skip the firmware section and go straight to [give me the code!](givemethecode.md)

## The goal

![A photo of the end result](assets/goal.jpg "Photo")

A functioning macropad with 6 customizable hotkeys and a clickable volume knob.

## Steps

1. First we'll [solder the headers](solder-headers.md) on to the microcontroller.
2. Required [software setup](software-setup.md).
3. Next we can connect the [rotary encoder](rotary-encoder.md) and program it to work as a volume knob for our PC.
4. Now the hard part, wiring up all of our [keyboard switches](switches.md).
5. Then we have the [assembly](assembly.md).
6. And finally the [finishing-touches](finishing-touches.md)!

Good luck!
