# Build your own Macro pad

We'll build our own macropad in this session. We'll mostly focus on learning to solder and putting everything together.

The firmware part is also described, if writing software isn't your thing, ask for some help to get the final code on your device. It's located in the [repository](https://github.com/itenium-be/BuildYourOwnMacroPad).

## The goal

![A photo of the end result](assets/goal.jpg "Photo")

A functioning macropad with 6 customizable hotkeys and a clickable volume knob.

## Steps

1. First we'll [solder the headers](solder-headers.md) on to the microcontroller.
2. Required [software setup](software-setup.md).
3. Next we can connect the [rotary encoder](rotary-encoder.md) and program it to work as a volume knob for our PC.
4. Now the hard part, wiring up all of our [keyboard switches](switches.md).
5. Then we have the [assembly](assembly.md).
6. And finally the [finishing-touches](finishing-touches.md)!

Good luck!

I've added a [parts list](parts-list.md) as well, if you ever want to build another macro pad.
